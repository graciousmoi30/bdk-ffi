# Architectural Decision Records

This directory contains a series of Architectural Decision Records or "ADRs" for the bdk-ffi project. We're going to use it as a kind of collective memory of the decisions we've made and the path we've taken to get the project to its current point.

A good example of simple and well executed ADRs can be found on the [uniffi](https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/) project repository. See their [readme](https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/tree/main/docs/adr) and [template](https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/blob/main/docs/adr/template.md) for more information.
